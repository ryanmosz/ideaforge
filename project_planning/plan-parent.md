# Parent Task Development Plan Request

**IMPORTANT**: This prompt follows the PRD generation process defined in `.cursor/rules/create-feature-prd.mdc`. The output will create a new file named `prd-parent-task-[TASK-ID].md` in the `/tasks/` directory.

## Context

I need a detailed development plan for a specific parent task from the IdeaForge technical implementation plan. The full project context is available in:
- **project_planning/claude-prd.md** - Complete Product Requirements Document
- **project_planning/technical-implementation-plan.md** - Overall task breakdown  
- **project_planning/tech-stack-definition.md** - IMMUTABLE tech stack (never change these technologies)
- **AGENT-HANDOFF.md** - Current project state

**CRITICAL**: The tech stack defined in tech-stack-definition.md is immutable. All implementation must use exactly these technologies and versions. Do not suggest alternatives or upgrades.

## Using Internal Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: Before implementing any task, consult the **Internal Documentation Guide** at `.cursor/rules/custom/internal-docs-guide.mdc`. This guide provides:
- Complete list of all indexed documentation (TypeScript, Jest, Commander.js, LangGraph, etc.)
- How to effectively query internal docs instead of using web search
- Code examples and best practices for each technology
- Version-specific information matching our dependencies

**Always prefer internal documentation over web searches** - it's faster, more accurate, and version-matched to our project.

## Process

Generate a comprehensive development plan for the parent task shown at the bottom of this prompt. The plan should include:

### 1. **Task Overview**
   â€¢ Summary of what this parent task accomplishes
   â€¢ How it fits into the overall IdeaForge architecture
   â€¢ Dependencies on other parent tasks
   â€¢ What will be possible after this task is complete

### 2. **Technical Design**
   â€¢ Detailed architecture for this component
   â€¢ Key interfaces and data structures
   â€¢ Integration points with other components
   â€¢ Technology-specific considerations (using ONLY the approved tech stack)

### 3. **Implementation Sequence**
   â€¢ Ordered list of subtasks with rationale for sequence
   â€¢ Critical path identification
   â€¢ Parallel work opportunities
   â€¢ Risk points that might cause rework

### 4. **Detailed Subtask Breakdown**
   For each subtask provide:
   â€¢ **Description**: What exactly needs to be built
   â€¢ **Implementation Steps**: Concrete steps a junior developer can follow
   â€¢ **Code Examples**: Sample code or pseudocode where helpful
   â€¢ **File Changes**: Which files to create/modify
   â€¢ **Testing Approach**: How to verify it works
   â€¢ **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria
   â€¢ **Common Pitfalls**: What to watch out for

### 5. **Testing Strategy**
   â€¢ Unit test requirements for this component
   â€¢ Integration test scenarios
   â€¢ Manual testing procedures
   â€¢ Mock data or services needed

### 6. **Integration Plan**
   â€¢ How to integrate with existing code
   â€¢ API contracts with other components
   â€¢ Configuration requirements
   â€¢ Migration steps if refactoring

### 7. **Documentation Requirements**
   â€¢ Code documentation standards
   â€¢ README updates needed
   â€¢ API documentation
   â€¢ Usage examples

### 8. **Functional Requirements**
   - Numbered list of specific functionalities
   - Clear, implementation-focused requirements
   - Technical specifications

### 9. **Success Metrics**
   â€¢ How to measure successful completion
   â€¢ Performance benchmarks if applicable
   â€¢ Quality metrics

### 10. **Next Steps**
   â€¢ What becomes possible after this task
   â€¢ Which parent tasks should follow
   â€¢ Future enhancement opportunities

## Testing Procedure Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Every task implementation MUST follow this testing procedure:

### For Each Subtask:
1. **Create Test Files First**
   - Write comprehensive test files BEFORE or ALONGSIDE implementation
   - Test files go in `/tests/` mirroring the `/src/` structure
   - Include both positive and negative test cases
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Verify Tests Pass**
   - Run `npm test` after implementing each subtask
   - ALL tests must pass before moving to the next task
   - Fix any failing tests immediately
   - Never skip or comment out failing tests

3. **Test Coverage Requirements**
   - Each new function/method needs at least one test
   - Critical logic needs multiple test scenarios
   - Error handling paths must be tested
   - Integration points need specific tests

4. **Manual Testing When Appropriate**
   - Create temporary test scripts for complex features
   - Document manual testing steps performed
   - Clean up temporary test files after verification
   - Note any manual tests that should become automated tests

5. **Test File Naming**
   - Match source file names: `feature.ts` â†’ `feature.test.ts`
   - Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
   - Group related tests in describe blocks

### Example Test Implementation:
```typescript
// For a parser in src/parsers/data-extractor.ts
// Create tests/parsers/data-extractor.test.ts

describe('DataExtractor', () => {
  describe('extractUserStories', () => {
    it('should extract well-formed user stories', () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle missing components gracefully', () => {
      // Test error cases
    });
  });
});
```

**IMPORTANT**: If you're picking up work from a previous agent, always run `npm test` first to understand the current state. Never assume tests are passing.

## Formatting Requirements

- Use clear markdown formatting
- Include code blocks with language tags
- Use tables where helpful for structured data
- Keep language clear for junior developers
- Include actual file paths and function names
- Reference specific lines from the PRD where applicable

### Step 3: Task List Generation

Following the Parent Task Development Plan Request, I will generate detailed task lists using the format from `generate-tasks.mdc`:

1. **tasks-parent-[TASK-ID]-checklist.md** - Checkbox list with task codes
2. **tasks-parent-[TASK-ID]-detailed.md** - Detailed implementation information

### Step 4: Detailed Task File Management (500-Line Limit)

When creating detailed task files:

1. **File Length Target**: Aim for approximately 500 lines per detailed task file
   - This keeps files manageable and focused
   - Allows for easier review and navigation
   - Prevents overwhelming documentation

2. **Multiple Detail Files**: When a parent task requires more than 500 lines of detail:
   - Create multiple numbered files: `tasks-parent-[TASK-ID].[SUBTASK-ID]-detailed.md`
   - Example: `tasks-parent-5.6.1-detailed.md`, `tasks-parent-5.6.2-detailed.md`, etc.
   - Each file should cover a logical grouping of subtasks

3. **Checklist References**: When multiple detail files exist:
   - Update the checklist to indicate which file contains each subtask's details
   - Add notes under parent task entries showing the file mapping
   - Example format:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] 5.6 Integration testing and documentation
       - [ ] 5.6.1 Create end-to-end integration tests (Details in: tasks-parent-5.6.1-detailed.md)
       - [ ] 5.6.2 Test complete research flow (Details in: tasks-parent-5.6.1-detailed.md)
       - [ ] 5.6.4 Update project README (Details in: tasks-parent-5.6.2-detailed.md)
     ```

4. **File Organization Guidelines**:
   - Group related subtasks in the same detail file
   - Never delete successfully created files
   - Maintain logical coherence within each file
   - Include clear headers indicating which subtasks are covered

## Output

The final output will be saved as:
- **PRD**: `/tasks/prd-parent-task-[TASK-ID].md`
- **Checklist**: `/tasks/tasks-parent-[TASK-ID]-checklist.md`
- **Details**: `/tasks/tasks-parent-[TASK-ID]-detailed.md`

## Target Audience

The primary reader is a **junior developer** implementing their first CLI project. Requirements must be:
- Explicit and unambiguous
- Free of unnecessary jargon
- Include concrete examples
- Provide clear success criteria

Remember to move any previous *plan*, *checklist* and *detailed* file to `tasks/complete/` first!
