# Research Features Status Report

## Current State: ⚠️ 90% Complete - Needs Workflow Deployment

### What's Working ✅
1. **n8n Client & Bridge**: Fully implemented with rate limiting and caching
2. **Workflows Created**: Both HackerNews and Reddit workflows exist in `n8n-workflows/`
3. **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript types for all research APIs
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallbacks when research is unavailable
5. **Caching System**: Smart cache manager with TTL strategies
6. **Rate Limiting**: Dual-layer protection (client + workflow)

### What's NOT Working ❌
1. **Workflows Not Deployed**: Old workflows still active in n8n
   - HackerNews workflow returns echo response (not searching)
   - Reddit workflow needs OAuth configuration
2. **Deployment Script Issues**: `deploy.sh` needs manual intervention

### Time to Demo-Ready: 15 minutes

## Required Steps for Demo

### Step 1: Clear Old Workflows (5 minutes)
```bash
# Option A: Via n8n UI (Recommended)
open http://localhost:5678
# 1. Go to Workflows
# 2. Delete/Deactivate any existing IdeaForge workflows
# 3. Import new workflows via UI

# Option B: Via deploy script
cd n8n-workflows
./deploy.sh --force  # May need to add force flag
```

### Step 2: Import & Activate Workflows (5 minutes)
1. In n8n UI (http://localhost:5678):
   - Click "Import from File"
   - Import `n8n-workflows/hackernews-search.json`
   - Import `n8n-workflows/reddit-search.json`
   - Import `n8n-workflows/health-check.json`
   - **ACTIVATE each workflow** (toggle switch)

### Step 3: Verify (5 minutes)
```bash
# Test HackerNews
node scripts/verify-hn-response.js
# Should show: "✅ Workflow is configured correctly"

# Test actual search
node scripts/test-hn-webhook.js "typescript"
# Should return actual search results
```

## Research Features Capabilities

### HackerNews Search ✅ (Ready)
- Searches via Algolia API
- No authentication required
- Returns:
  - Title, URL, author, points
  - Comments count
  - Relevance scoring
  - Publication date

### Reddit Search ⚠️ (Requires OAuth)
- Needs Reddit app credentials
- Once configured, searches:
  - Multiple subreddits
  - Posts and comments
  - Filters NSFW content
  - Quality scoring

## Demo Script Behavior

The `demo-all-in-one.sh` script handles everything:
1. ✅ Checks prerequisites (Node.js, Docker)
2. ✅ Installs dependencies
3. ✅ Configures environment (.env)
4. ✅ Starts n8n in Docker
5. ⚠️ Deploys workflows (needs manual verification)
6. ✅ Runs demo with research

## Fallback if Research Fails

The system gracefully handles missing research:
- Still performs AI analysis
- Shows message: "Research unavailable, using AI analysis only"
- Demo still impressive without research
- Research adds "community insights" layer

## Configuration for Replication

Your exact config (works on demo machine):
```env
# n8n Configuration
N8N_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678
N8N_WEBHOOK_PATH=webhook
N8N_API_KEY=local-dev-api-key-12345
N8N_TIMEOUT=30000
N8N_RETRIES=3
```

This is automatically set by the demo script.

## Reddit OAuth (Optional Enhancement)

To enable Reddit search:
1. Create app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Add to .env:
   ```env
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT=IdeaForge/1.0
   ```
3. Re-import Reddit workflow

## Summary

**Research features are 90% ready**. The only blocker is workflow deployment in n8n. Once workflows are properly imported and activated (15 minutes), the full demo with research will work perfectly.

The `demo-all-in-one.sh` script automates 95% of the setup. Manual workflow activation is the only step that might need attention.
