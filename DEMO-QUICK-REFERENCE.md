# IdeaForge Demo Quick Reference

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Message
"IdeaForge transforms project ideas into actionable plans in minutes, not hours"

## ðŸ’¡ Key Differentiators

### vs Traditional Planning
- **Traditional**: Hours of meetings â†’ vague requirements â†’ scope creep
- **IdeaForge**: 15 minutes â†’ AI-powered MoSCoW analysis â†’ clear priorities

### vs Grammarly (Demo Example)
- **Grammarly**: Fixes grammar mistakes
- **Our Clone**: Transforms tone & optimizes for conversions
- "Grammarly fixes what you wrote. We make sure you write what sells."

## ðŸš€ Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### 1. Show the Problem (30 seconds)
"How many projects fail due to poor planning? 70%! Let me show you a better way..."

### 2. Quick Setup Demo (1 minute)
```bash
# Already done, but mention:
npm run setup        # Just needs OpenAI key
npm run test:grammarly  # One command demo
```

### 3. Show Input File (1 minute)
```bash
cat example-grammarly-clone.org
```
Point out:
- Simple Org format
- Marketing-focused user stories
- Pre-tagged requirements (MUST/SHOULD/COULD)

### 4. Run Analysis (1 minute)
```bash
ideaforge analyze example-grammarly-clone.org
```
Watch as it:
- Evaluates each requirement
- Adds AI suggestions
- Generates MoSCoW scores

### 5. Show Results (1.5 minutes)
```bash
cat grammarly-analysis.org
```
Highlight:
- **Tone transformation**: MUST HAVE (95/100)
- **AI suggestions**: Sentiment analysis, A/B testing
- **Risk alerts**: API costs, competitive landscape

## ðŸ”¥ Powerful One-Liners

- "Stop guessing what to build. Start knowing."
- "15 minutes of planning saves 15 hours of rework"
- "AI doesn't replace your judgmentâ€”it enhances it"
- "Every feature gets three questions: What if we skip it? Is there a simpler way? Can it work without this?"

## ðŸŽ­ If Things Go Wrong

### OpenAI Error
"The AI is just one partâ€”the MoSCoW framework itself is proven methodology"

### Demo Crashes
"That's why we plan before we code! Let me show you the example output..."
(Have grammarly-analysis.org ready to display)

### Research Features Don't Work
"The core analysis works perfectly offline. Research features are a bonus that pulls in community wisdom from HackerNews and Reddit"

## ðŸ“Š Stats to Mention

- 70% of projects fail due to poor planning
- MoSCoW method used by thousands of companies
- Saves 10x time vs traditional requirements gathering
- Export directly to Cursor/VS Code task format

## ðŸŽ¬ Strong Close

"In 5 minutes, we went from a vague idea to a prioritized, AI-enhanced project plan. Imagine what you could build if every project started this clearly."

**Call to Action**: "Try it yourselfâ€”just run `npm run demo` and see your own ideas transformed!"
