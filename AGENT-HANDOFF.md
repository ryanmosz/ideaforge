## Cursor Documentation Setup
See `project_planning/cursor-documentation-setup.md` for detailed instructions. Key docs to add:
- Node.js API: https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/
- TypeScript: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
- Commander.js: https://github.com/tj/commander.js#readme
- Axios: https://axios-http.com/docs/intro
- Jest: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started
- Ora: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ora (use npm page, not GitHub)
- Plus 6 other relevant documentation sources

The setup guide includes CLI-specific gotchas, red flags to watch for, and IdeaForge-specific patterns.

## Planning Documents
- **prompt.md**: Main development guidelines for AI assistants working on IdeaForge
- **plan-project.md**: Template for generating full project development plans based on PRD
- **plan-parent.md**: Template for generating detailed plans for individual parent tasks
- **cursor-documentation-setup.md**: Step-by-step guide for configuring Cursor with proper documentation
- **claude-prd.md**: Comprehensive Product Requirements Document defining IdeaForge features and architecture
- **technical-implementation-plan.md**: Complete task breakdown with 12 parent tasks
- **tech-stack-definition.md**: IMMUTABLE technology specifications and version control policy
- **git-workflow.md**: Standard Git workflows with code names for common operations

## Planning Workflow
1. Use **plan-project.md** for overall project planning (generates tasks-ideaforge-checklist.md and tasks-ideaforge-detailed.md)
2. Use **plan-parent.md** for detailed planning of each parent task:
   - Copy the entire content of plan-parent.md
   - Paste it into your chat/prompt
   - Copy a parent task from technical-implementation-plan.md
   - Paste the parent task at the very end after "## Parent Task to Plan"
3. Generated plans create new files (e.g., parent-task-4.0-plan.md)
4. Previous iterations should be moved to project_planning/retired/
5. **All implementations must adhere to tech-stack-definition.md**

## Git Workflow
- **SUBTASK-COMMIT**: Use when working on subtasks - stages all files and commits on current branch
- **PARENT-COMPLETE**: Use when finishing a parent task - commits, merges to main, pushes, and creates new feature branch
- See `project_planning/git-workflow.md` for detailed instructions

## PRD Key Features (from claude-prd.md)
- n8n + LangGraph architecture for intelligent planning
- Technology extraction and external research (Hacker News, Reddit)
- Full MoSCoW framework with specific evaluation questions
- Iterative refinement with :RESPONSE: tags
- Progress messaging throughout execution
- Export to Cursor markdown and org-mode formats

## Tech Stack Policy
**The tech stack defined in tech-stack-definition.md is IMMUTABLE**. This includes:
- Node.js v16.0.0+ with TypeScript 5.3.0
- CommonJS modules (no ESM)
- Specific versions of all dependencies
- n8n + LangGraph architecture
- No upgrades or changes without explicit written approval

## Next Steps & Opportunities
1. **NPM Publishing**: Package could be published to npm registry for easier installation
2. **CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases
3. **Tests**: Implement unit tests using the Jest configuration
4. **Documentation**: Expand examples and use cases
5. **Features**: 
   - Implement n8n webhook integration
   - Add LangGraph state management
   - Integrate external research APIs
   - Enhance progress messaging system

## Known Issues
None currently identified - project is in initial working state.

## Maintenance Notes
- Run `npm run lint` to check code style
- Run `npm test` to execute tests (once implemented)
- Update version in package.json before releases
- Keep README.md synchronized with new features
- Use updated prompt.md for consistent development approach
- Follow cursor-documentation-setup.md when configuring development environment
- Use plan-project.md for full project planning
- Use plan-parent.md for detailed parent task planning (copy file, paste task at end)
- Move old generated plans to project_planning/retired/
- Use git-workflow.md for standard Git operations (SUBTASK-COMMIT and PARENT-COMPLETE)
- **Never modify tech stack without explicit approval**

    - `/tasks/tasks-parent-1.0-detailed.md` - Detailed implementation guide (unchanged)

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Planning Process Changes**:
   - No clarifying questions - generate plans directly
   - Parent tasks follow development plan format (not PRD)
   - Task lists use checkbox format with task codes (T101, T102, etc.)
   - One sub-task at a time implementation rule enforced
   - Relevant files section maintained in task lists

2. **Task Management**:
   - Task completion protocol: mark sub-tasks [x] when done
   - Parent task marked complete only when all sub-tasks done
   - Must ask for permission before proceeding to next sub-task
   - Regular updates to task list files required
