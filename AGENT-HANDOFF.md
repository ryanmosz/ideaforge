# IdeaForge Project Handoff

## Project Overview
IdeaForge is a CLI tool that transforms project ideas into actionable plans using MoSCoW and Kano frameworks. It helps developers plan their projects before writing code by analyzing requirements, prioritizing features, and generating implementation strategies.

## Current State (as of handoff)
- ✅ **Fully functional CLI tool** with all planned commands implemented
- ✅ **Published to GitHub**: https://github.com/ryanmosz/ideaforge
- ✅ **TypeScript codebase** with proper build configuration
- ✅ **All dependencies installed** and project builds successfully
- ✅ **Initial commit pushed** with complete project structure

## Repository Information
- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/ryanmosz/ideaforge
- **Branch**: main (default)
- **Visibility**: Public
- **Description**: Transform your project ideas into actionable plans using MoSCoW and Kano frameworks

```

## Available Commands
1. `ideaforge init` - Creates a new project template
2. `ideaforge analyze` - Analyzes project ideas with AI
3. `ideaforge refine` - Iterates on analysis with feedback
4. `ideaforge flow` - Generates architecture diagrams
5. `ideaforge tables` - Extracts MoSCoW/Kano tables
6. `ideaforge export` - Exports plans to various formats

## Setup Instructions
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanmosz/ideaforge.git
cd ideaforge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# The project will build automatically via the prepare script
# Or manually build with:
npm run build

# Test the CLI
./bin/ideaforge -h
```

## Development
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js (>=16.0.0)
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - commander (CLI framework)
  - axios (HTTP requests)
  - chalk (terminal styling)
  - ora (loading spinners)

## Technical Details
- Uses CommonJS modules for Node.js compatibility
- TypeScript compiles to ES2022 target
- Executable script at `bin/ideaforge` requires compiled JS from `dist/`
- Includes ESLint and Jest configurations for code quality

## Current Features
- Template-based project planning with Org-mode format
- AI-powered analysis of requirements
- MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Kano model integration (Basic/Performance/Excitement)
- Architecture flow diagram generation
- Export to multiple formats (Markdown, JSON, Cursor tasks)
- Iterative refinement workflow

## Next Steps & Opportunities
1. **NPM Publishing**: Package could be published to npm registry for easier installation
2. **CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and releases
3. **Tests**: Implement unit tests using the Jest configuration
4. **Documentation**: Expand examples and use cases
5. **Features**: 
   - Add more export formats
   - Integrate with project management tools
   - Add template library for common project types
   - Support for multiple AI providers

## Known Issues
None currently identified - project is in initial working state.

## Maintenance Notes
- Run `npm run lint` to check code style
- Run `npm test` to execute tests (once implemented)
- Update version in package.json before releases
- Keep README.md synchronized with new features
