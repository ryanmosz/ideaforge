# Agent Handoff Document

This document tracks the current state of the IdeaForge project, recent progress, and next steps for seamless agent transitions.

## Project Overview
IdeaForge is a CLI tool that transforms project ideas into actionable development plans using AI analysis, MoSCoW/Kano frameworks, and external research integration.

## Current Task Status

### Active Parent Task: 5.0 - Develop n8n integration for external APIs
**Status**: Task 5.1 Complete, Task 5.2 Complete, Task 5.3 Next
**Location**: Feature branch `feature/task-5.0-n8n-integration`
**Progress**: 2 of 6 main tasks complete

### Recent Accomplishments
