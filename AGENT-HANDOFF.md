## Next Task: 5.5 - Add rate limiting and caching

Subtasks to implement:
- [x] 5.5.1: Implement rate limiter utility
- [x] 5.5.2: Add rate limiting to n8n workflows
- [x] 5.5.3: Create cache manager service

### Next Steps:
1. **Task 5.5.5 - Add TTL-based expiration**
   - Note: Basic TTL is already implemented in the cache manager
   - Need to implement dynamic TTL strategies based on content type
   - Create TTL strategies for different query patterns (trending vs static content)
   - Consider time-of-day adjustments for cache duration
   - Implement query-based TTL decisions

2. **Task 5.5.6 - Build cache warming logic**
   - Proactively cache popular queries
   - Refresh expiring cache entries before they expire
   - Create a background cache warming service

### Setup Instructions:
1. Create Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   export REDDIT_USER_AGENT="IdeaForge/1.0 (by /u/your_username)"
   ```
3. Verify OAuth setup: `node scripts/verify-reddit-oauth.js`
4. Import workflow in n8n: `n8n-workflows/reddit-search.json`
5. Test basic webhook: `node scripts/test-reddit-webhook.js`
6. Test Phase 2 features: `node scripts/test-reddit-phase2.js`
7. Test Phase 3 filtering: `node scripts/test-reddit-phase3.js`
8. Test OAuth refresh: `node scripts/test-reddit-oauth-refresh.js`
9. Test rate limits: `node scripts/test-reddit-rate-limits.js`

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure n8n is running
npm run n8n:local

# Verify workflow status
node scripts/verify-hn-response.js

# Test HN webhook (after re-import)
node scripts/test-hn-webhook.js "typescript"

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Test rate limiting
npm run test:rate-limits

# Re-import workflows with rate limiting
node scripts/add-rate-limiting-to-workflows.js
```

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Pragmatic Testing**: Focused on core functionality over edge cases
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with fallbacks at every level
3. **Session Tracking**: Automatic with configurable cleanup
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Separate per service (HN/Reddit)
5. **HN Integration**: Direct Algolia API with custom relevance scoring
6. **Enhanced Scoring**: Multi-factor algorithm with technology patterns
7. **Rate Limiting**: Dual-layer protection (client-side and n8n workflow)
   - Client-side prevents requests before they reach n8n
   - Workflow-side enforces limits and handles API responses
   - Sliding window algorithm for accurate tracking

## Known Issues
- **URGENT**: Old workflow still active in n8n - needs re-import

## Conversation Summary: IdeaForge Task 5.5 - Rate Limiting and Caching Implementation

### Initial Context
- Working on IdeaForge project - a CLI tool for transforming project ideas into actionable plans using MoSCoW and Kano frameworks
- Current task: Parent Task 5.5 - Add rate limiting and caching to n8n integration
- Branch: feature/task-5.0-n8n-integration
- Tech stack constraints: Node.js, TypeScript, CommonJS (no ESM), 500-line file limit

### Task 5.5 Overview
The task involves implementing rate limiting and caching for the n8n integration layer that connects to external APIs (HackerNews and Reddit). The implementation plan was divided into 8 subtasks:
1. Implement rate limiter utility
2. Add rate limiting to n8n workflows
3. Create cache manager service
4. Implement cache key generation
5. Add TTL-based expiration
6. Build cache warming logic
7. Add monitoring and metrics
8. Test under load conditions

### User Preferences
- Memory-based caching is sufficient (no Redis)
- 100MB cache size is reasonable
- Cache should start fresh (no persistence between CLI runs)
- Avoid extra complexity
- No need for cache statistics CLI command

### Subtask 5.5.1 Implementation (Completed)
Created `src/utils/rate-limiter.ts` with:
- RateLimiter class implementing sliding window algorithm
- Support for per-key tracking (different users/sessions)
- APIRateLimitManager for managing multiple API limits
- Configured limits:
  - HackerNews: 10,000 requests/hour, 10/second max
  - Reddit: 60 requests/10 minutes, 1/second max
  - Default: 1,000 requests/hour, 5/second max
- Features: automatic waiting, rate limit rejection handling, statistics tracking
- Fixed config mutation issue to ensure immutability
- Created comprehensive unit tests (26 tests, all passing)

### Subtask 5.5.2 Implementation (Completed)
Added rate limiting to n8n workflows:

1. **Script Creation**: Created `scripts/add-rate-limiting-to-workflows.js` to automatically add rate limiting nodes to workflows

2. **n8n Workflow Updates**:
   - Added "Check Rate Limits" function nodes that enforce limits before API requests
   - Added "Handle Rate Limit Response" nodes to handle 429 errors
   - Updated both HackerNews and Reddit workflows with rate limiting logic
   - Rate limiter uses workflow static data for persistence within n8n

3. **Client Integration**: Updated `src/services/n8n-client.ts`:
   - Added rate limit checks before searchHackerNews() and searchReddit()
   - Proper error handling for rate limit violations
   - Added getRateLimitStats() method for monitoring
   - Fixed error flow to return error responses instead of throwing

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:

   - Added npm script `test:rate-limits`
   - Updated unit tests with rate limiting scenarios
   - Fixed test issues with mock expectations and error handling

5. **Test Fixes**: 
   - Fixed Jest matcher issues (toHaveBeenCalledBefore doesn't exist)

   - `QueryBasedTTLStrategy` - Uses query patterns to determine cache duration
   - `TimeAwareTTLStrategy` - Adjusts TTL based on day of week and time
   - `CombinedTTLStrategy` - Uses multiple strategies (most conservative)
   - TTL ranges from 5 minutes (time-sensitive) to 24 hours (static content)

2. **Created `src/services/smart-cache-manager.ts`**:
   - Extends CacheManager with TTL strategies
   - Tracks query popularity for TTL adjustments
   - Provides trending queries analysis
   - Cache effectiveness metrics
