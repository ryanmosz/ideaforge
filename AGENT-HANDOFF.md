# AGENT HANDOFF

## Current Status

**Date**: 2024-12-20
**Branch**: feature/task-5.0-n8n-integration
**Active Task**: Ready to start Task 5.3 - Implement Hacker News API integration

## Recent Completions

### Task 5.2: Build communication bridge to LangGraph ✅
All 8 subtasks completed:
- ✅ 5.2.1: n8n client service class
- ✅ 5.2.2: Webhook request methods
- ✅ 5.2.3: Timeout and retry logic
- ✅ 5.2.4: Response transformation layer
- ✅ 5.2.5: LangGraph bridge interface
- ✅ 5.2.6: Session correlation
- ✅ 5.2.7: Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ 5.2.8: Comprehensive unit tests (96%+ coverage)

### Key Implementation Details
1. **N8nBridge** fully operational with:
   - Circuit breakers for HN/Reddit services
   - Session tracking with metrics
   - Fallback responses when services unavailable
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Test Suite Optimized**:
   - 704 tests, all passing
   - ~11 second runtime (down from 30s)
   - 96%+ coverage on core functionality
   - Focused on realistic scenarios

3. **Infrastructure Ready**:
   - All error types defined
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern implemented
   - Session correlation working

## Next Task: 5.3 - Implement Hacker News API integration

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance must be running locally
- HackerNews webhook workflow deployed (already exists in n8n-workflows/)
- N8nBridge ready to consume HN results

### Task Details
From tasks-parent-5.3-detailed.md:
1. Add HN search nodes to n8n workflow
2. Configure Algolia API parameters
3. Implement response parsing
4. Add relevance scoring
5. Create TypeScript types for HN data
6. Test with various search queries
7. Handle edge cases and errors

### Important Context
- The n8n workflows are already created (hackernews-search.json)
- The N8nBridge expects specific response format from n8n
- Circuit breakers are already in place for HN service
- Focus on making the n8n workflow actually functional

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure n8n is running
npm run n8n:local

# Run tests
npm test

# Test specific integration
npm test -- tests/agents/bridges/n8n-bridge.test.ts
```

## Technical Decisions Made
1. **Pragmatic Testing**: Focused on core functionality over edge cases
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with fallbacks at every level
3. **Session Tracking**: Automatic with configurable cleanup
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Separate per service (HN/Reddit)

## Known Issues
- None currently blocking progress
