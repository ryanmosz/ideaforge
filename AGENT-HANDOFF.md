# Agent Handoff Document

This document tracks the current state of the IdeaForge project, recent progress, and next steps for seamless agent transitions.

## Project Overview
IdeaForge is a CLI tool that transforms project ideas into actionable development plans using AI analysis, MoSCoW/Kano frameworks, and external research integration.

9. **Task 5.1.5 Completed**: CORS headers for local development
   - Added "Respond to Webhook" nodes to both workflows
   - Configured CORS headers:
     - Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (allows any origin for dev)
     - Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS
     - Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-API-Key
     - Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
   - Updated Code nodes to handle OPTIONS preflight requests
   - Webhook nodes reconfigured to use "Respond to Webhook Node" mode
   - Both webhooks tested with OPTIONS and POST requests

### Next Immediate Steps:
**Continue Task 5.2 with subtask 5.2.8: Write comprehensive unit tests**
1. Review existing test coverage
2. Add any missing edge cases
3. Ensure all error scenarios are tested
4. Test integration between components
5. Verify circuit breaker behavior under load

### n8n Integration Clarification:
- Current code has a placeholder `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` that isn't implemented yet
- Task 5.0 will build the actual n8n integration
- Two options for n8n:
  - **Local**: Run with Docker at http://localhost:5678 (recommended for dev)
  - **Cloud**: Use n8n.cloud instance if you have an account
- Will refactor config to use `N8N_BASE_URL` and `N8N_API_KEY` separately
- User has Elestio n8n instance configured as `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` (ready for production)
- Local development env configured and n8n running successfully

### Implementation Approach:
- **Phased implementation** with testing checkpoints between phases
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Natural testing points to ensure quality
- Estimated 21-28 hours total development time

### Completed Parent Tasks:
- ✅ 1.0 Set up project foundation and development environment
- ✅ 2.0 Implement org-mode parsing and file handling  
- ✅ 3.0 Build CLI framework and command structure
- ✅ 4.0 Implement LangGraph agent architecture

## Technical Context
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js, TypeScript, Commander.js, LangGraph, n8n (IMMUTABLE - see tech-stack-definition.md)
- **Architecture**: Functional programming, max 500 lines per file, CommonJS modules
- **Testing**: Jest with comprehensive test coverage, tests required for all new code
