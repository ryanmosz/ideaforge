### Setup Instructions:
1. Create Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   export REDDIT_USER_AGENT="IdeaForge/1.0 (by /u/your_username)"
   ```
3. Verify OAuth setup: `node scripts/verify-reddit-oauth.js`
4. Import workflow in n8n: `n8n-workflows/reddit-search.json`
5. Test basic webhook: `node scripts/test-reddit-webhook.js`
6. Test Phase 2 features: `node scripts/test-reddit-phase2.js`
7. Test Phase 3 filtering: `node scripts/test-reddit-phase3.js`
8. Test OAuth refresh: `node scripts/test-reddit-oauth-refresh.js`
9. Test rate limits: `node scripts/test-reddit-rate-limits.js`

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure n8n is running
npm run n8n:local

# Verify workflow status
node scripts/verify-hn-response.js

# Test HN webhook (after re-import)
node scripts/test-hn-webhook.js "typescript"

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Test rate limiting
npm run test:rate-limits

# Re-import workflows with rate limiting
node scripts/add-rate-limiting-to-workflows.js
```

## Technical Decisions
- Dual-layer rate limiting (client + n8n workflow)
- Sliding window for accurate request tracking
- No persistence between CLI runs
- LRU eviction for memory management
- Deterministic cache keys with parameter sorting
- UTC time for time-based keys (timezone consistency)
- Dynamic TTL based on content type and usage patterns
- Query pattern matching for intelligent cache duration

## Current Status
- Task 5.5 is COMPLETE! All 8 subtasks finished successfully
- Total tests passing: 887+ (including load tests)
- Rate limiting, caching, monitoring, and load testing are fully integrated
- System performance validated under load conditions

## Conversation Summary: IdeaForge Task 5.6 Demo Preparation

### Initial Context
- User working on IdeaForge project (CLI tool for project planning using MoSCoW/Kano frameworks)
- Branch: feature/task-5.0-n8n-integration
- Task 5.6: Integration testing and documentation
- User has demo deadline in a few hours, needs minimal viable implementation

### Task 5.6 Pruning Strategy
- User requested aggressive pruning of 8 subtasks to meet demo deadline
- Assistant created streamlined plan focusing on essentials:
  - Phase 1: Quick integration test (5.6.1)
  - Phase 2: README updates (5.6.4, 5.6.7)
  - Phase 3: Demo helper script
- Deferred 5 subtasks (5.6.2, 5.6.3, 5.6.5, 5.6.6, 5.6.8) marked as "POST-DEMO"

### Implementation Phase 1: Integration Test
- Created `tests/integration/demo-research-flow.test.ts`
- Minimal test verifying research flow works end-to-end
- Fixed import/type errors through multiple iterations
- Test passes, showing n8n responds (though with string response)

### Implementation Phase 2: Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md with:
  - Research feature highlighted with ⭐ emoji
  - `--research` flag in usage examples
  - Compelling example showing AI insights from HackerNews/Reddit
- Marked subtasks 5.6.4 and 5.6.7 complete

### Implementation Phase 3: Demo Infrastructure
- Created `scripts/demo-ideaforge.js` - automated demo with AI Task Manager example
- Added `npm run demo` command
- Created `DEMO-CHECKLIST.md` with pre-demo setup steps

### Grammarly Clone Example Creation
User provided project overview for 7-day Grammarly clone challenge. Assistant created:
- `example-grammarly-clone.org` - sparse Org mode document
- Focused on marketing professionals as target users
- Key features: AI-powered tone transformation, persuasion enhancement
- User stories specific to marketing managers
- Brainstorming section with differentiators from Grammarly

### Demo Setup for Contributors
User emphasized need for foolproof setup when colleagues clone the repo. Major fixes:

1. **Configuration Issues Fixed**:
   - N8N_WEBHOOK_URL was incorrectly required, blocking basic demos
   - Updated `src/config/index.ts` to make n8nWebhookUrl optional
   - Updated `src/cli/index.ts` to only require OPENAI_API_KEY
   - Fixed related tests to handle optional n8n

2. **Created Demo Infrastructure**:
   - `scripts/test-grammarly-example.js` - test script for Grammarly example
   - Fixed chalk dependency issues (removed due to ESM/CommonJS conflict)
   - `scripts/setup-demo.js` - interactive setup prompting for OpenAI key
   - Added npm scripts: `npm run setup`, `npm run test:grammarly`

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added "Quick Demo (5 minutes)" section to README
   - Added "Demo for Contributors" section with copy-paste commands
   - Clear instructions: clone → npm install → npm run setup → npm run test:grammarly

### Final Demo State
- Only OpenAI API key required (n8n truly optional)
- 2-minute setup process for new contributors
- Marketing-focused Grammarly clone example showcasing:
  - Tone transformation (happy, urgent, professional)
  - Persuasion enhancement for conversions
  - Clear differentiation from basic grammar checking
- One-command demo: `npm run test:grammarly`
- Created `DEMO-READY-CHECKLIST.md` with talking points and backup plans

### Environment Setup Documentation
- Created comprehensive `TESTER-SETUP-GUIDE.md` for Mac testers
- Clarified that OpenAI runs locally via LangGraph (not through n8n)
- n8n only needed for optional research features (HackerNews/Reddit)
- Documented Docker Desktop requirements and setup process
- Provided exact working n8n configuration from demo environment
- Added troubleshooting section for common issues
- Created `DEMO-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` with talking points and fallback strategies

### Key Achievements
- Reduced setup friction from multiple environment variables to just OpenAI key
- Created compelling demo narrative: "Grammarly fixes grammar, we optimize conversions"
- Made example file easily modifiable for experimentation
- Total time from clone to demo: ~5 minutes
- All changes maintain compatibility with existing codebase
- Clear separation: Basic features (OpenAI only) vs Research features (Docker + n8n)

### Research Features Assessment
- Research features are 90% complete - only workflow deployment remains
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: n8n has old "echo" workflows that must be replaced before demo
- Created `scripts/fix-n8n-workflows.js` to detect and fix workflow issues
- Created `scripts/demo-all-in-one.sh` - one-command setup taking OpenAI key as argument
- Script automates: Docker check, n8n setup, workflow deployment, demo execution
- Created visual Mermaid diagrams showing system architecture and demo flow
- Research adds "community insights" from HackerNews/Reddit to AI analysis
- System gracefully falls back if research unavailable
- Time to full demo-ready: 5 minutes to fix workflows + demo time

### Workflow Issue Details
The n8n instance currently has test workflows that just echo back requests instead of calling APIs:
- **Symptom**: Research returns the request payload instead of search results
- **Fix**: Delete old workflows, import new ones from n8n-workflows/, activate them
- **Quick Check**: Run `npm run demo:fix-n8n` to diagnose and get instructions
- **Fallback**: Demo works perfectly without research - just use `npm run test:grammarly`

### Files Created in Final Phase
- `TESTER-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive Mac setup guide
- `DEMO-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Demo presenter cheat sheet
- `RESEARCH-FEATURES-STATUS.md` - Detailed assessment of research readiness
- `PRE-DEMO-FIX-CHECKLIST.md` - Quick fix guide for workflow issue
- `DEMO-DECISION-TREE.md` - Simple flowchart for demo decisions
- `scripts/demo-all-in-one.sh` - Automated full setup script
- `scripts/fix-n8n-workflows.js` - Diagnose and fix n8n workflow issues
- Visual diagrams showing data flow and workflow issue
