# Task 4.8.4: Add Progress Event Streaming - Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the AgentRunner service with a sophisticated progress event streaming system that buffers events for better performance while ensuring immediate delivery of critical error messages.

## Implementation Details

### Progress Buffering System
- Added progress event buffering with 100ms flush interval to reduce event overhead
- Implemented immediate flush for error events to ensure timely error reporting
- Added graceful cleanup in `finally` blocks to prevent memory leaks

### Key Methods Added
1. **`startProgressBuffer()`** - Initializes the buffering interval
2. **`stopProgressBuffer()`** - Cleans up interval and flushes remaining events
3. **`flushProgressBuffer()`** - Emits all buffered events at once
4. **`createProgressSummary()`** - Generates percentage-based progress messages
5. **`emitAggregatedProgress()`** - Provides overall execution summary

### Progress Event Enhancements
- Enhanced debug logging with emojis for different event levels:
  - ‚ùå for errors
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è for warnings  
  - üìç for info
- Added aggregated progress reporting showing percentage completion
- Maintained compatibility with existing ProgressManager interface

### Integration Points
- Updated both `analyze()` and `refine()` methods to use buffering
- Ensured proper cleanup on both success and failure paths
- Maintained backward compatibility with CLI event handlers

## Testing Updates
- Added comprehensive tests for buffering behavior
- Implemented fake timers to control event flushing in tests
- Added test for immediate error emission
- Fixed memory leak issues with proper timer cleanup

## Benefits
1. **Better Performance** - Reduced event emission overhead during heavy processing
2. **Improved UX** - Aggregated progress provides clearer status updates
3. **Error Visibility** - Critical errors are still delivered immediately
4. **Debug Support** - Enhanced logging with visual indicators

## Next Steps
Task 4.8.5 will integrate the AgentRunner into the existing CLI commands, replacing direct parsing logic with the new agent-based approach.
