# Task 3.0 - Build CLI Framework and Command Structure

## Checklist

- [x] **3.1** Implement main CLI entry point with Commander.js
- [ ] **3.2** Create analyze command for initial processing
- [ ] **3.3** Create refine command for iterative improvements
- [ ] **3.4** Create export command with format options
- [ ] **3.5** Create visualization commands for diagrams and tables
- [x] **3.6** Implement progress messaging system

Implementation Order: 3.6 → 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.4 → 3.3 → 3.5
Start with the progress system (3.6) as it's needed by all commands
Build the CLI foundation (3.1) before implementing commands
Implement core commands in order of complexity

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Run `npm test` after each subtask implementation
- [ ] All tests must pass before moving to the next subtask
- [ ] Create test files alongside implementation files
- [ ] Test both positive and negative cases
- [ ] Verify manual testing procedures from the PRD

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] All CLI commands are functional
- [ ] Progress indicators work in all modes (normal, verbose, quiet, no-emoji)
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] All file paths resolve correctly
- [ ] Export formats work as expected
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage for CLI code
