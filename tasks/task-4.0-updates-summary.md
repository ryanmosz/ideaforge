## Configuration & Features

### AI Model Configuration âœ…
- Support for o3-mini (default), gpt-4.1, and gpt-4.5-preview models
- CLI `--model` option for analyze and refine commands
- Environment variable AI_MODEL support
- Created `createLLM` factory function in utils/llm-factory.ts
- All nodes updated to use configurable models
- Documentation in docs/AI_MODEL_CONFIGURATION.md
- Cursor rules created in .cursor/rules/ai-model-config.mdc

### Node Implementation Standards
- All nodes implement either `invoke()` or `process()` async methods
- Consistent error handling with state.errors array
- Progress messages added to state.messages
- Proper TypeScript types for all inputs/outputs
- Mock-friendly design for testing
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95% for all nodes)

## Key Implementation Details

### Routing Architecture
- Centralized routing logic in `edges/routing.ts`
- Clear separation between main flow, refinement flow, and error handling
- Proper use of LangGraph's END constant for terminal states
- Avoided duplicate conditional edges on nodes
- Flow map defines standard node transitions

### State Management
- ProjectState serves as single source of truth
- Each node updates only relevant state properties
- Messages array provides execution trace
- Errors array enables graceful failure handling
- nextNode property allows flow control overrides

### Testing Strategy
- Simplified graph tests focus on compilation and structure
- Routing functions tested independently
- Mock all node implementations for graph tests
- Focus on behavior rather than internal properties

## Next Steps

- Create FileSystemMemorySaver for checkpoint storage
- Implement session management
- Add state recovery logic
- Handle version conflicts

### Task 4.8: Create LangGraph-CLI Communication Layer
- Build AgentRunner service
- Integrate with existing CLI commands
- Add progress reporting
- Handle interruptions
