### Implementation Details

Created `HackerNewsSearchNode` that searches Hacker News via the Algolia API using multiple strategies to capture relevance, influence, importance, and recency. Now includes detailed selection context explaining WHY each result was chosen.

**Multi-Strategy Search Approach:**
1. **Front Page Recent** (must-read): Posts with 100+ points from last 48 hours (2x relevance boost)
2. **Trending**: High velocity posts (5+ points/hour) from last week (1.5x relevance boost)
3. **Relevant**: Traditional keyword search for highly relevant content
4. **Influential**: All-time posts with 500+ points (1.3x relevance boost)

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Velocity Scoring**: Calculates points per hour to identify trending content
- **Influence Indicators**: 
  - 🔥 Front Page: 100+ points within 48 hours
  - 📈 Trending: High velocity (10+ points/hour)
  - ⭐ Influential: 500+ points all-time
- **Composite Relevance Scoring**:
  - Base points contribution (0-40)
  - Engagement/comments (0-30)
  - Recency bonus (0-20, granular by days)
  - Title keyword matching (0-30)
  - Viral bonus for high comment-to-point ratios (+10)
- **Smart Deduplication**: Keeps highest relevance score when same post appears in multiple strategies
- **Result Categorization**: Summary shows breakdown by category (must-read, trending, influential, relevant)

**NEW: Selection Context & Relationship Analysis**:
- **Selection Reason**: Explains WHY each result was included
  - "Front page discussion directly related to your topic"
  - "Rapidly gaining traction (32 points/hour)"
  - "Highly influential discussion (2500 points, 800 comments)"
- **Relationship Mapping**: Describes HOW each result relates to the search topic
  - Direct matches: "Matches keywords: react, hooks"
  - Same domain: "Related frontend technology"
  - Cross-domain: "Cross-domain insight: backend perspective on frontend"
  - General wisdom: "General engineering wisdom applicable to your domain"
  - Performance: "Performance insights that may apply to your use case"
  - Business context: "Product/business context for technical decisions"

**Technology Category Detection**:
- Automatically categorizes posts into domains (frontend, backend, devops, data, mobile, security, architecture)
- Identifies cross-domain insights that might be valuable
- Recognizes general engineering patterns applicable across domains

**Enhanced Summary Format:**
```
🔥 Front Page: Posted 12 hours ago | 250 points (21/hr) | 89 comments
📎 Front page discussion directly related to your topic
🔗 Matches keywords: performance, optimization
[Content excerpt from story...]

📈 Trending: Posted today | 150 points (50/hr) | 45 comments
📎 Highly influential recent discussion with potential relevance
🔗 Cross-domain insight: backend perspective on frontend
[Highlighted search results...]
```

**Files Updated:**
- `src/agents/nodes/research/HackerNewsSearchNode.ts` - Added selection context analysis
- `tests/agents/nodes/research/HackerNewsSearchNode.test.ts` - Added tests for context features

**Test Coverage:**
- All 14 tests passing (added 3 new tests)
- Tests for tangential relationships, direct matches, and general wisdom

This enhanced implementation ensures users understand not just WHAT content was found, but WHY it was selected and HOW it relates to their search, making it easier to identify valuable insights even from tangentially related discussions.
