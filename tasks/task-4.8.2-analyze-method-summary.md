# Task 4.8.2: Implement analyze method - Summary

## What I Implemented

### Core analyze() Method
The `analyze` method in `AgentRunner` now:
1. Loads document content directly from filesystem
2. Creates or retrieves a session using SessionManager
3. Builds the LangGraph with checkpointer for state persistence
4. Executes the graph with real-time progress streaming
5. Transforms the final state to match CLI's AnalysisResult interface
6. Handles interruptions gracefully with state saving

### Key Implementation Details

**Document Loading**
- Added `loadDocumentContent` helper that reads files directly
- Returns raw content string for initial state
- Future versions may integrate FileHandler for parsed data

**State Initialization**
```typescript
const initialState: Partial<ProjectState> = {
  filePath: documentPath,
  fileContent: rawContent,
  refinementIteration: 0,
  currentNode: 'documentParser',
  errors: [],
  messages: []
};
```

**Progress Streaming**
- Created `ProgressAdapter` that converts CLI ProgressManager interface to AgentRunner events
- Each node execution emits progress events
- Real-time updates flow to CLI spinner

**State Transformation**
- `transformToAnalysisResult` converts ProjectState to CLI's expected format
- Maps MoscowAnalysis (Requirement[]) to expected BrainstormIdea[] format
- Handles missing properties with sensible defaults
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Test Coverage
- Full analysis execution test
- Interruption handling test  
- Progress event streaming test
- All tests passing with proper mocks

### Technical Challenges Resolved

1. **Type Mismatches**: Fixed incompatibilities between ProjectState and CLI types
2. **Graph API Issues**: Added type assertions to work around LangGraph TypeScript issues
3. **File Loading**: Simplified to direct fs.readFile instead of complex FileHandler integration
4. **Memory Saver Mock**: Created comprehensive mock for testing checkpointer functionality

### Next Steps
With analyze() complete, the next task is implementing the refine() method which will:
- Handle documents with :RESPONSE: tags
- Resume from existing session state
- Execute refinement nodes
- Generate changelog of changes
