# Task 5.4 Phase 3 - Reddit API Integration: Content Filtering & Quality Scoring

## Summary

Successfully completed Phase 3 of Reddit API integration, implementing comprehensive content filtering and quality scoring system in the n8n workflow.

## Completed Subtask

### 5.4.4 - Add content filtering (NSFW, deleted) ✅

Implemented a comprehensive content filtering node that:

1. **Content Filters**:
   - NSFW/Spoiler content removal (default: enabled)
   - Deleted/removed content filtering (default: enabled)
   - Locked post filtering (default: enabled)
   - Controversial content filtering (optional)
   - Minimum score threshold
   - Minimum comment count
   - Maximum age filtering
   - Author blacklisting
   - Domain blacklisting
   - Text requirement for self posts

2. **Quality Scoring Algorithm**:
   - **Posts**: Base score from upvotes, comment engagement, upvote ratio, awards, content indicators (code blocks, links), engagement ratio
   - **Comments**: Base score, depth penalty, length bonus, awards/gilding, code detection
   - **Time Decay**: Newer content receives higher scores
   - **Score Ranges**: 0-2000+ with categorization (High Quality >1000, Quality >500)

3. **Low-Effort Comment Detection**:
   - Filters out single words: "this", "yes", "no", "lol", etc.
   - Removes pattern-only comments: "^^^", "!!!", "+1"
   - Minimum length requirement: 20 characters

4. **Visual Quality Indicators**:
   - ⭐ HIGH QUALITY: Posts/comments with quality score >1000
   - ✨ QUALITY: Posts/comments with quality score >500
   - 📄 Standard: Regular quality content
   - ✅ Highly upvoted: Posts with >90% upvote ratio

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New Workflow Node: "Apply Content Filters"
- Positioned between "Search Posts & Comments" and "Transform Results"
- Filters content based on user-provided criteria
- Calculates quality scores for all content
- Sorts by quality score
- Provides detailed filter statistics

### 2. Enhanced Request Validation
- Added filter options to request validation
- Default filters for safety (NSFW, deleted content)
- Customizable filter parameters

### 3. Enhanced Response Metadata
- Filter statistics (posts/comments filtered)
- Quality score distribution
- Average quality scores
- Top content quality scores

### 4. Test Suite Created
- `scripts/test-reddit-phase3.js`: Comprehensive test scenarios
- Tests default filtering, strict filtering, controversial content
- Quality score verification
- Author/domain blacklisting
- Recent high-quality content filtering

## Key Features

1. **Flexible Filtering**: Users can customize all filter parameters
2. **Smart Defaults**: Safe defaults that filter NSFW and deleted content
3. **Quality-First**: Results sorted by quality score after relevance
4. **Transparent**: Filter statistics show what was removed
5. **Performance**: Efficient filtering in single pass

## Usage Examples

### Strict Quality Filter
```javascript
{
  query: "typescript best practices",
  options: {
    filters: {
      minScore: 10,
      minComments: 5,
      maxAge: 90,
      removeControversial: true,
      requireText: true
    }
  }
}
```

### Include Controversial Content
```javascript
{
  query: "framework debate",
  options: {
    filters: {
      removeControversial: false,
      removeLocked: false
    }
  }
}
```

### Recent High-Quality Only
```javascript
{
  query: "web trends 2024",
  options: {
    filters: {
      minScore: 50,
      maxAge: 7,
      minComments: 10
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Phase 4 (Reliability) remaining tasks:
- 5.4.6: Test OAuth token refresh
- 5.4.7: Verify rate limit compliance

The workflow now provides high-quality, filtered Reddit content with comprehensive safety and quality controls.
