# Task 4.8.7: Add Comprehensive Error Handling - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented robust error handling for the IdeaForge application, providing helpful error messages, retry logic for transient failures, and a troubleshooting guide for users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Error Classification System (`src/services/agent-runner.ts`)
- **Added `classifyError()` Method**
  - Detects and categorizes different types of errors
  - Provides context-specific error messages with actionable solutions
  - Supports debug mode for detailed error information
  
- **Error Categories Handled**:
  - **API Key Errors**: Clear instructions for setting up OpenAI API key
  - **Rate Limit Errors**: Suggestions for waiting or using different models
  - **File Not Found**: Guidance on checking paths and file existence
  - **Model Errors**: List of available models and usage instructions
  - **Network Errors**: Connection troubleshooting steps
  - **Session/Checkpoint Errors**: Options for clearing sessions or using --fresh flag
  - **Generic Errors**: Enhanced with context information

### 2. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- **Added `withRetry()` Method**
  - Automatically retries transient failures (rate limits, timeouts, connection resets)
  - Implements exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s (max 10s)
  - Default 3 attempts before giving up
  - Skips retry for non-retryable errors (API key missing, file not found)
  - Emits progress events for retry attempts

### 3. Error Handling Wrapper
- **Added `withErrorHandling()` Method**
  - Wraps operations to provide consistent error classification
  - Adds context to error messages
  - Used for document loading operations

### 4. Integration with Core Methods
- **Updated `analyze()` Method**
  - Document loading wrapped with error handling
  - Graph execution wrapped with retry logic
  - Maintains all existing functionality
  
- **Updated `refine()` Method**
  - Same error handling and retry enhancements
  - Consistent error experience across operations

### 5. CLI Troubleshooting Command (`src/cli/index.ts`)
- **Added `troubleshoot` Command**
  - Provides comprehensive troubleshooting guide
  - Lists common issues and their solutions
  - Includes helpful links and debug instructions
  - Easy access via: `ideaforge troubleshoot`

### 6. Comprehensive Test Coverage (`tests/services/agent-runner-errors.test.ts`)
- **Error Classification Tests**
  - Validates each error type is properly classified
  - Ensures helpful messages are provided
  - Tests debug mode logging
  
- **Retry Logic Tests**
  - Confirms retry behavior for transient errors
  - Verifies non-retryable errors fail immediately
  - Tests exponential backoff timing
  - Validates progress event emission

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Error Messages**
   ```
   OpenAI API key not configured.
     1. Copy .env.example to .env
     2. Add your OpenAI API key
     3. Try again
   ```

2. **Automatic Retry with Progress**
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è [retry] Analysis execution failed (attempt 1/3), retrying in 1000ms...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è [retry] Analysis execution failed (attempt 2/3), retrying in 2000ms...
   ```

3. **Debug Mode Support**
   - Set `DEBUG=1` to see full error details and stack traces
   - Helps developers troubleshoot complex issues

4. **Troubleshooting Guide**
   - Run `ideaforge troubleshoot` for help
   - Covers common issues and solutions
   - Links to documentation and support

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - No more cryptic error messages
   - Clear guidance on fixing issues
   - Automatic handling of temporary failures

2. **Resilience**
   - Transient network issues handled automatically
   - Rate limits managed with retry logic
   - Graceful degradation when errors occur

3. **Developer Friendly**
   - Debug mode for detailed diagnostics
   - Consistent error handling patterns
   - Comprehensive test coverage

4. **Production Ready**
   - Handles edge cases gracefully
   - Provides actionable error messages
   - Supports recovery from failures

## Testing Results
- Added 12 new tests for error handling
- All 503 tests passing
- Error scenarios thoroughly covered
- No impact on existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### Handling Missing API Key
```bash
$ ideaforge analyze project.org
Error: OpenAI API key not configured.
  1. Copy .env.example to .env
  2. Add your OpenAI API key
  3. Try again
```

### Automatic Retry on Rate Limit
```bash
$ ideaforge analyze large-project.org
‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis execution failed (attempt 1/3), retrying in 1000ms...
‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis execution failed (attempt 2/3), retrying in 2000ms...
‚úÖ Analysis complete!
```

### Troubleshooting Help
```bash
$ ideaforge troubleshoot
üîß IdeaForge Troubleshooting Guide
[... comprehensive help text ...]
```

This implementation ensures IdeaForge provides a professional, user-friendly experience even when things go wrong. Users get clear guidance on resolving issues, and the system automatically handles many common failure scenarios.
