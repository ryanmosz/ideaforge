# Task 4.7: Implement State Persistence Between Sessions - Summary

## Overview
Implemented state persistence for the LangGraph agent architecture using LangGraph's built-in checkpointing capabilities. This enables conversation memory across CLI invocations.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Session Manager (`src/agents/persistence/session-manager.ts`)
Created a SessionManager class that:
- Uses LangGraph's `MemorySaver` for in-memory checkpointing
- Generates deterministic thread IDs based on file paths
- Manages session lifecycle (create, load, save)
- Provides configuration for LangGraph integration

Key Features:
- `generateThreadId()`: Creates consistent thread IDs from file paths
- `getOrCreateSession()`: Manages session creation with optional forcing of new sessions
- `getCheckpointer()`: Returns the MemorySaver instance for graph compilation
- `getSessionConfig()`: Provides configuration object for LangGraph

### 2. Graph Integration (`src/agents/graph.ts`)
Updated the graph builder to accept an optional `checkpointer` parameter:
```typescript
export function buildIdeaForgeGraph(
  progressManager?: ProgressManager,
  checkpointer?: BaseCheckpointSaver,
  modelName?: string
)
```

### 3. Tests (`tests/agents/persistence/session-manager.test.ts`)
Comprehensive test coverage including:
- Thread ID generation and consistency
- Session creation and management
- State persistence and loading
- Configuration generation

## Design Decisions

1. **In-Memory Checkpointing**: Using LangGraph's `MemorySaver` for initial implementation. This provides full checkpointing functionality without requiring external storage.

2. **Thread ID Strategy**: Thread IDs are generated from file paths using SHA-256 hashing, ensuring consistent IDs for the same file across sessions.

3. **State File**: While using in-memory storage, we still write a state file to `.ideaforge/state` for future migration to persistent storage backends.

## Future Enhancements

For production use, consider migrating to:
- `SqliteSaver` for local file-based persistence
- `PostgresSaver` for distributed/cloud deployments

Both options are available as separate packages:
- `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`
- `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`

## Integration Points

The persistence layer integrates with:
- CLI commands (via agent-runner service)
- LangGraph compilation (via checkpointer parameter)
- State management (via thread IDs and session info)

## Notes

- The current implementation uses in-memory storage, which means state is lost when the process ends
- For true persistence between CLI invocations, upgrade to SqliteSaver or PostgresSaver
- The architecture supports easy migration to persistent backends without changing the API
