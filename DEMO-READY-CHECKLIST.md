## For Your Colleagues

When they clone the repo:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run setup
   # Enter OpenAI key when prompted
   ```

2. **Run Demo**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:grammarly
   ```

3. **Explore**:
   - View input: `cat example-grammarly-clone.org`
   - View output: `cat grammarly-analysis.org`
   - Modify and re-run!

## Your Demo Flow

1. Show the compelling use case (marketing writing assistant)
2. Run the demo: `npm run test:grammarly`
3. Show the MoSCoW prioritization in output
4. Highlight unique features (tone transformation)
5. Show how easy it is to modify and re-run

## Key Talking Points

- **"Grammarly fixes grammar, we optimize conversions"**
- **"AI understands marketing goals, not just rules"**
- **"From idea to actionable plan in minutes"**
- **"See how it prioritizes features automatically"**

## What They Can Play With

The `example-grammarly-clone.org` file has sections they can modify:
- User stories (change the user type)
- Requirements (add new features)
- Technology choices (try different stacks)
- Brainstorming (add their own ideas)

Every change produces different analysis results!

## Backup Plan

If anything fails:
- The example files are already created
- Show existing `grammarly-analysis.org`
- Focus on the planning methodology
- Mention external research as "coming soon"
