# IdeaForge üöÄ

**Transform your project ideas into actionable plans before writing a single line of code.**

IdeaForge is a command-line tool that helps developers and project managers thoroughly plan projects using the MoSCoW prioritization framework combined with Kano model insights. By investing 15-30 minutes in structured planning, you can save weeks of development time and avoid costly pivots.

## üéØ Why IdeaForge?

### The Problem
- **70% of software projects fail** due to poor planning and scope creep
- Developers often start coding before fully understanding requirements
- Ideas get lost between brainstorming and implementation
- Features are built that users don't actually need

### The Solution
IdeaForge ensures you:
- ‚úÖ **Build the right features first** using proven MoSCoW analysis
- ‚úÖ **Avoid scope creep** with clear "Won't have" boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Get AI-powered suggestions** for features you might have missed
- ‚úÖ **Iterate quickly** through file-based refinement loops
- ‚úÖ **Export actionable plans** directly to your development workflow

## üåü Key Features

### 1. **Full MoSCoW Analysis with AI Evaluation**
- **Must Have**: Critical features evaluated with three key questions
- **Should Have**: Important features with value/effort analysis
- **Could Have**: Nice-to-haves prioritized by user impact
- **Won't Have**: Clear boundaries to prevent scope creep

### 2. **Iterative Refinement Loop**
```
Initial Ideas ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Your Feedback ‚Üí Refined Plan ‚Üí Final Export
```
Edit the output, add `:RESPONSE:` tags, and re-process for better results.

### 3. **External Intelligence Gathering**
Automatically pulls relevant discussions from:
- Hacker News threads about your tech stack
- Reddit communities discussing similar projects
- Recent trends and best practices

### 4. **Smart Export Options**
- **Org-mode**: Full analysis with tables, changelog, and tags
- **Markdown**: Cursor-compatible task lists ready for development

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ideaforge.git
cd ideaforge

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Link globally (optional)
npm link
```

### Configuration
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Add your API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# For external research features (optional)
# See docs/n8n-setup.md for detailed setup
N8N_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5678
N8N_API_KEY=local-dev-api-key-12345
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Initialize a new project template:**
```bash
ideaforge init
# Creates ideaforge-template.org in current directory
```

2. **Fill out the template** with your:
   - User stories
   - Requirements (pre-tagged with MUST/SHOULD/COULD/WONT)
   - Technology choices
   - Brainstormed ideas

3. **Analyze your project:**
```bash
ideaforge analyze my-project.org --output analysis-v1.org
```

4. **Refine the analysis:**
```bash
# Edit analysis-v1.org, add :RESPONSE: tags with feedback
ideaforge refine analysis-v1.org --output analysis-v2.org
```

5. **Export final plan:**
```bash
ideaforge export analysis-final.org --format cursor --output tasks.md
```

## üìã Example Workflow

### Input (Org-mode Template)
```org
* User Stories
** As a developer
   I want to quickly validate my project ideas
   So that I don't waste time building the wrong features

* Requirements
*** MUST User authentication                                          :MUST:
    Secure login system for user data protection
    
*** SHOULD Real-time notifications                                  :SHOULD:
    Keep users engaged with instant updates

* Technology Choices
** Backend/Hosting
*** Option 1: Firebase
*** Option 2: Supabase

* Brainstorming
** Core Features
   - Social login integration
   - Dashboard with analytics
   - Email notifications
   - Mobile app support
```

### Output (After Analysis)
```org
* MoSCoW Analysis Results

** MUST HAVE (2 items)
*** User authentication [Score: 95/100]
    AI Rationale: Critical for data security and user management
    - Impact if excluded: System completely unusable (100/100)
    - Simpler alternative: No, authentication is fundamental
    - Works without: No, core functionality depends on user identity

** SHOULD HAVE (1 item)
*** Dashboard with analytics [Score: 75/100]
    AI Rationale: High value for user engagement, can launch without

** AI SUGGESTIONS
*** Consider implementing:
    1. Password reset flow (commonly forgotten requirement)
    2. Rate limiting for API security
    3. User profile management

*** Architecture Recommendation:
    Based on your requirements, Supabase offers better real-time
    capabilities than Firebase for notification features.

* External Intelligence
** Recent Discussions:
   - HN: "Supabase vs Firebase in 2024" - key insight about auth flows
   - Reddit r/webdev: Similar project launched with these features...

* Changelog
** v1: Initial analysis - Added AI suggestions for security features
```
